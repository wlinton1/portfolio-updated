# portfolio-updated

# wettimlinton123@gmail.com

I updated the layout of my portfolio based on what the TA's of the class are informing us.

Made it so everything a potential employer could see will be on a single page to allow easier access. 

Updated project 2 placeholder as well as put a new homework on project 3 placeholder.

Updated github repo with new pinned repos, deployed updated portfolio and going to link it to my linkedin. 

Added phone number and buttons for github and linkedin accounts. changed styling and layout of the page. 

keeping files in the portfolio folder in case i want to make changes or add to them later on, took functionality of navbar away since it is all on one page now, but wil keep it within the code in case i want to make changes later.
